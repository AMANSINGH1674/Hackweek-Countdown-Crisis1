# Hackweek Countdown Crisis

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

- **Critical Null Reference Error Fixed:**
  - The `CommunityInfo` component previously fetched `cosc.json` at runtime, causing a null reference error during SSR/SSG builds. This was fixed by statically importing `cosc.json` and removing all async fetch logic.
- **Hydration Mismatch Error Fixed:**
  - Removed all client/server conditional logic (such as `typeof window !== 'undefined'`) from the `style` prop in `page.js` to ensure consistent server and client rendering, resolving hydration errors.
- **Deployment Ready:**
  - The app is now compatible with static hosting platforms like Netlify and Vercel, with no runtime or build-time errors.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
